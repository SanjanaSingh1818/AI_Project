## AI Algorithms

The AI opponent in this Tic Tac Toe game is implemented using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for improved performance. The AI can be set to different difficulty levels:

- Easy: The AI makes random moves.
- Medium: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with limited lookahead.
- Hard: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal moves.
